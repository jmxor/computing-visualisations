# Computing Visualisations

This project is an expansion on my 3rd year dissertation project "interactive security visualisations" to be a general collection of interactive computing visualisations rather than for security specifically, hence the name "Computing Visualisations".

This is a web based project build on NextJS and TailwindCSS
